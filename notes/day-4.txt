passing data between components

1. passing data between shallowly nested components
	a. passing data from nested to its parent component: event-bidning
	
	In nested component => 
	i. create a property which is of type EventEmitter
	ii. decide which type of value to emit
	iii. decorate the property with @utput() decorator (@angualr/core package)
	iv. emit the value bu calling "this.eventPropName.emit(value)"


	In parent component design=>
	bind the event to a method in component's code
	<app-x (event-propname)="method($event)">

	In parent component's code=>
	method(value:any){
		//code to do something with the received value
	}
