passing data between components

1. passing data between shallowly nested components
	a. passing data from nested to its parent component: event-bidning
	
	In nested component => 
	i. create a property which is of type EventEmitter
	ii. decide which type of value to emit
	iii. decorate the property with @utput() decorator (@angualr/core package)
	iv. emit the value bu calling "this.eventPropName.emit(value)"


	In parent component design=>
	bind the event to a method in component's code
	<app-x (event-propname)="method($event)">

	In parent component's code=>
	method(value:any){
		//code to do something with the received value
	}

	b. passing data from parent to nested component: data-binding

	In nested component:
	declare a property with @Input() decorator
	@Input() prop-name:type=<init-val>

	In parent component design: [do data binding of that @Input() property]
	<app-x [prop-name]="data-from-parent">
