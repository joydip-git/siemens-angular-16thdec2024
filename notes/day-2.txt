asynchronity in JS/TS:
---------------------------------
JS is single threaded, you can't create multiple threads from JS.
JS can take advantage of the environment where the JS code is running.

ex: Node JS, though is a JS-based server side framework, but uses extra threads (6). Out of them 4 threads are deciated to reading data from or writing data to a file etc. JS can request to get a functikn executed in an extra thread without blocking the main thread.

ES6 feature: Promise API
give promise api a taks to get executed without blocking the main thread.

RxJS:
------------------
observable object
observer object => watch an observable. collection of callbacks and those callbacks are executed when the observable object receives data or error and if any other task to do after observable receives data
of => operator (function)

Subject			=> 
BehaviorSubject		=>
ReplaySubject		=>

XMLHttpRequest object:
---------------------------------
	     init send  received processing complete
readyState => 0  -> 1   -> 2      -> 3       -> 4
readystatechange => event, which gets fired every time readystate value changes
